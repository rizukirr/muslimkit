- Interactive city selection interface with dual navigation modes:
  - **Default mode**: Arrow keys for navigation
  - **Vim mode**: j/k (up/down), g/G (top/bottom), Ctrl+U/Ctrl+D (page navigation), '/' (search), 'q' (quit)
  - Toggle between modes with Ctrl+/
- HTTPS/SSL connection handling
- JSON response parsing
- Chunked transfer encoding support

### In Development ðŸš§

- Prayer time fetching and display
- Desktop notification system

### Planned ðŸ“‹

- Islamic calendar integration
- Sunnah reminder system
- Customizable notification preferences
- International prayer times reminder support
- Configuration file management

## Requirements

- CMake 4.0 or higher
- C compiler (GCC or Clang)
- OpenSSL development libraries
- valgrind (Optional for developer)

### Installing Dependencies

**Arch Linux:**

```bash
sudo pacman -S cmake openssl
```

**Debian/Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt install cmake libssl-dev
```

**Fedora:**

```bash
sudo dnf install cmake openssl-devel
```

## Building

```bash
# Configure the build
cmake -B build

# Compile
cmake --build build

# Run the application
./build/muslimkit
```

## Architecture

The project follows a clean three-layer architecture designed for extensibility:

1. **Network Layer**: Low-level TCP/SSL connections and HTTP protocol handling
2. **Domain Layer**: Business logic, data models, and API integration
3. **Presentation Layer**: Terminal UI using the embedded termbox library

The architecture is designed to accommodate future expansion with dedicated subdirectories for models, services, repositories, and configuration management.

## Usage

### Current Features

1. Launch the application: `./build/muslimkit`
2. Browse and search through Indonesian cities
3. Navigate using arrow keys or vim keybindings (toggle with Ctrl+/)
4. Select your city

### Future Usage

Once fully implemented, muslimkit will run as a background service, providing:

- Automatic prayer time notifications
- Islamic calendar reminders
- Time-based sunnah recommendations
- Customizable notification settings

## Development

This project uses consistent patterns for memory management, error handling, and architectural organization. Key principles:

- Each allocating function has a corresponding `_free()` function
- Clean separation of concerns across layers
- Modular design for easy feature addition
- Header files organized by architectural layer

## API

muslimkit uses the [MyQuran API](https://api.myquran.com) for:

- Indonesian city listings
- Prayer time schedules
- Islamic calendar data

## Contributing

Please ensure your code:

- Follows the existing architectural patterns
- Maintains the memory management conventions
- Includes appropriate error handling
